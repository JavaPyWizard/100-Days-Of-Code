# 💯 100 Days of Code – Master Plan 🚀

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey where I’m diving deep into **Data Structures**, **Data Science**, and **Web Development** — all from scratch!

📌 **Note**: This planner is a flexible roadmap. Daily tasks may vary depending on pace, interest, or external learning — and that’s okay! The goal is *consistency, not perfection*.

## ✨ Why All Three Tracks?
I want to build a **well-rounded software skillset**:
- 👨‍💻 **DSA** = Problem-solving + Interviews
- 📊 **Data Science** = Math + AI + real-world modeling
- 🌐 **Web Development** = Building powerful frontend + backend apps
